Ranking customers using lightgbm for enhanced telemarketing of a bank's term deposit subscriptions

Dataset source and description: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#

The project was executed in one of my graduate degree courses in which I had to pick a dataset and create value using machine learning. A lightgbm model was trained to classify whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit on being approached via phone call. The customers are then ranked using output probability for enhanced telemarketing efforts.
